        <p id="subpagesubheader">Being Queer
        </p>

            <p id="subpagetext">
              I use they/them pronouns, and I'm transgender/non-binary.  
            </p>
            <p id="subpagetext">
              My identity is important to me, and it's driven me to learn about the queer community. I'm interested in queer history, symbolism, representation, language, and more. 
            </p>
            <p id="subpagetext">
              I do a lot of student activism, and I collaborate with other LGBTQ+ students in Oregon to encourage queer solidarity and safety.

        <p id="subpagesubheader">Houseplants
        </p>

          <p id="subpagetext">
              I've had hundreds of houseplants over the past few years. The hobby started in 2019, when I picked up four houseplants from Dennis 7 Dee's, a local plant store. Since then, my collection has exploded in size. I constantly research houseplants, and I can talk for hours about them. I've become an expert on houseplants and their care. 
          </p>
          <p id="subpagetext">
              If you have a dying succulent on your desk and you want to know what's wrong with it, don't hesitate to reach out! I'd love to diagnose the problem and help you solve it. 
          </p>

        <p id="subpagesubheader">Basketry
        </p>

          <p id="subpagetext">
            I started doing basketry as a camper at Camp Willowbrook, an arts summer camp. I got a job there in 2021, and taught basketry to kids aged 5-10. 
          </p>
          <p id="subpagetext">
            Now I do basketry on my own. I love using weaving to make art, and I'm creating a portfolio of my work in art class right now. I like contemporary basketry, advanced weaving techniques, and wire weaving.
          </p>

        <p id="subpagesubheader">Choir
        </p>

          <p id="subpagetext">
              I've been singing for five years, and I've been in multiple choirs. One was Bridging Voices, a chorus for queer youth in Portland. I sang with Bridging Voices for several years, and we even performed the National Anthem at a Trailblazer's game at the Moda Center.  
          </p>
          <p id="subpagetext">
            I also sang in my school's choir, Maverick Choir (Riverdale's mascot is a maverick). We were a small group, but we were loud. I sang a solo at our performance, it was a wonderful experience.
