              <p id="subpagetext">
                Riverdale High School is a highly individualized school in Oregon that has a large focus on college preparation. It's very small, about two hundred students. 
              </p>
              <p id="subpagetext">
                I'm a senior at Riverdale, and I'm about to graduate. I'll be going to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC, Canada next fall. I'll be majoring in software engineering.

             <p id="subpagetext">
               I'm president of our school's GSA, and I founded our Transgender Student Union. I'm highly involved in student activism at Riverdale. 
              </p>
             <p id="subpagetext">
               I've worked with Oregon GSAs in other high schools to set up events for LGBTQ+ students, and I've collaborated with them to strategize on student-led activism in board meetings and the like. I also ensured that gender-neutral restrooms were installed at our school, and helped organize and lead school-wide GSA events.
